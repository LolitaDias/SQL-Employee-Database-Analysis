# SQL Homework - Employee-Database-Analysis

![sql.png](sql.png)

## Background

In this assignment, we have designed the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. In other words, we have performed:

1. Data Modeling

2. Data Engineering

3. Data Analysis

The goal of this project was to extract, process, and analyze corporate employee data contained in multiple CSV datasets. The former tasks were completed using SQL queries (through PostgreSQL) to store and inspect the data, and the latter was performed using Python with Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib (through Jupyter Notebooks)to generate meaningful visualizations.

#### Data Modeling

Tasks:

Inspected the CSVs and sketched out an ERD of the tables. Used a tool  [http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com](http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com) to answer the question : How do the datasets of employee data relate to each other?

#### Data Engineering

Tasks:

Used the information we have to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Specified data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.

* Import each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table.

#### Data Engineering
